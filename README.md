# Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Cryptocurrencies 

The purpose of this excercise was the examine a set of cryptocurrencies using machine learning to determine how they could be clustered to create invesmtment classifications.  The data was pre-processed to numerical data and scaled.  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dataset and speed up analysis.  K-means was applied to determine the best number of clusters.  And finally a scatter plots were created to help visualize the results.
